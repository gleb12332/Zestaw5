Program description:

This program is a simple drawing tool that creates pictures on canvas and saves them to a file. The program is written in C++ and uses an object-oriented approach to creating images on canvas.

How to download the repository:

Make sure you have Git version control installed on your computer.
Open a terminal or console.
In the selected directory where you want to place the repository, execute the command:

git clone https://adres_repozytorium.git
Replace https://adres_repozytorium.git with the address of your actual repository.
How to compile the program:

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g. g++).
Go to the directory with the program repository.
Compile the program by executing the command:

g++ -o program program.cpp
Where program.cpp is the name of the program's source file.
How to use the program:

The program is launched from the command line. Here's how to use it:

./program <config_file>
<config_file>: Path to the configuration file that specifies what is drawn on the canvas.
Configuration file structure:

The configuration file should contain the following information:

canvas <width> <height>: Specify the canvas size, where <width> is the width and <height> is the height.
output <filename>: Specify the filename to which the image will be saved (can be blank if you don't want to save the image).
empty <symbol>: Specify a symbol representing an empty space on the canvas.
You can then define figures and lights in the configuration file using the following commands:

rectangle <x> <y> <width> <height> <symbol>: Specify a rectangle with the upper left corner at (<x>, <y>), width <width>, height <height> and symbol <symbol> .
circle <x> <y> <radius> <symbol>: Specify a circle centered at (<x>, <y>), radius <radius> and symbol <symbol>.
light <x> <y> <shadowSymbol>: Specify a light with position (<x>, <y>) and a shadow symbol <shadowSymbol>.
Configuration file example:


canvas 20 12
output output.txt
empty .
rectangle 3 2 2 2 #
rectangle 14 6 3 3 #
rectangle 0 2 3 2 .
rectangle 13 6 1 1 .
rectangle 12 7 2 1 .
rectangle 11 8 3 1 .
rectangle 10 9 7 1 .
rectangle 9 10 8 1 .
circle 17 2 0 *
light 15 3


This configuration file will create a 20X12 canvas, save the image to the "output.txt" file, use a dot "." as a blank space symbol, it will draw a rectangle "#", a circle "*" of light on the canvas.

After starting the program with the appropriate configuration file, an image will be created in accordance with the given parameters.
